This Python project performs a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data for three randomly selected countries. The dataset is first cleaned by checking for and addressing missing values, where missing numeric entries are filled using the median of neighboring values. Dates are properly formatted, and the relevant columns are selected for further analysis. The script generates line plots to visualize trends over time for key metrics such as cases, deaths, ICU and hospital admissions. It also creates quarterly box plots for each metric to highlight distribution and variability. In addition to visual insights, the script calculates statistical measures like the first quartile, median, and third quartile for each variable. The project aims to uncover meaningful patterns in the progression of the pandemic across different countries.
